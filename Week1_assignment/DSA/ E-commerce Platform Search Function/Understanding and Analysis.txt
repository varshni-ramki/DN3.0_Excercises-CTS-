Understand Asymptotic Notation:
Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, specifically how it scales with the size of the input data. It helps in understanding the efficiency of algorithms by providing an upper bound on their running time or space requirements, expressed in terms of the input size

n. This notation is crucial for comparing different algorithms and predicting their behavior as the input size grows.

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations
Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of steps, often when the desired element is found immediately. For example, in a linear search, the best case occurs when the target element is the first item in the array.
Average Case: The scenario that represents the expected number of steps an algorithm takes, averaged over all possible inputs. It provides a more realistic measure of an algorithm's performance under typical conditions.
Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of steps, typically when the desired element is not present in the dataset or is at the last position. This gives an upper bound on the time or space requirements and is useful for ensuring that performance is acceptable even in the most demanding situations.

 Analysis
Time Complexity Comparison
Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) ‚Äì When the target element is the first item.
Average Case: O(n) ‚Äì On average, the search examines half of the elements.
Worst Case: O(n) ‚Äì When the target element is the last item or not present.
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) ‚Äì When the target element is the middle item.
Average Case: O(log n) ‚Äì Each step halves the search space.
Worst Case: O(log n) ‚Äì The search space is halved until the element is found or the search space is exhausted.
Suitable Algorithm for the Platform
For an e-commerce platform, binary search is more suitable due to its logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)), making it significantly faster for large datasets compared to linear search (O(n)). However, it requires the data to be sorted, so maintaining a sorted array or using data structures like balanced binary search trees is necessary to leverage binary search effectively. This ensures faster search results, enhancing user experience and system performance.
