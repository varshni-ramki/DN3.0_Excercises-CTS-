Understand Search Algorithms
Linear Search
Linear search is a straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list is exhausted. It doesn't require the list to be sorted and works well for small datasets.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (when the target element is the first element)
Average Case: O(n) (where n is the number of elements)
Worst Case: O(n) (when the target element is the last element or not present)
Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, comparing the target value to the middle element of the list. If the target value is less than the middle element, it searches the left half; otherwise, it searches the right half.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (when the target element is the middle element)
Average Case: O(log n) (where n is the number of elements)
Worst Case: O(log n) (when the list has to be halved repeatedly until the target is found or the interval is empty)


 Analysis
Time Complexity Comparison
Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) – When the target element is the first element.
Average Case: O(n) – On average, the search examines half of the elements.
Worst Case: O(n) – When the target element is the last element or not present.
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) – When the target element is the middle element.
Average Case: O(log n) – Each step halves the search space.
Worst Case: O(log n) – The search space is halved until the element is found or the search space is exhausted.
When to Use Each Algorithm
Linear Search:

Use Cases: When the dataset is small or unsorted.
Advantages: Simple to implement and does not require the list to be sorted.
Disadvantages: Inefficient for large datasets due to linear time complexity.
Binary Search:

Use Cases: When the dataset is large and sorted.
Advantages: Much faster for large datasets due to logarithmic time complexity.
Disadvantages: Requires the list to be sorted, which may incur additional overhead.
In summary, for smaller or unsorted datasets, linear search is suitable due to its simplicity. For larger, sorted datasets, binary search is preferred due to its efficiency in reducing the search space logarithmically.
