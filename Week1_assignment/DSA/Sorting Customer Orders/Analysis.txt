 Analysis
Time Complexity Comparison
Bubble Sort:
Best Case: O(n) – When the array is already sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Quick Sort:
Best Case: O(n log n) – When the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal halves.
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) – When the pivot divides the array into two highly unequal halves (e.g., always picking the smallest or largest element as the pivot).
Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred Over Bubble Sort
Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort due to its significantly better average-case time complexity. While Bubble Sort is simple to implement, it becomes inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity. Quick Sort, on the other hand, efficiently divides and conquers the problem, making it suitable for large datasets with its average-case logarithmic time complexity. Despite having a worst-case complexity similar to Bubble Sort, Quick Sort's average performance is much better, making it a more practical choice for sorting large lists in real-world applications.
