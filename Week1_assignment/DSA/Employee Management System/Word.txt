Understand Array Representation
Explanation
Arrays are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed using an index. The advantages of arrays include:

Fast Access: Direct access to elements via index in constant time 
𝑂
(

)
O(1).
Fixed Size: Memory is allocated at the time of array creation, ensuring that the size is constant.
Advantages
Efficiency: Accessing elements by index is very efficient, providing constant time access.
Contiguity: Since the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, it helps in caching and thus improves performance.
Ease of Use: Simple to use and manage small datasets.

Analysis
Time Complexity
Add Operation: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) - Adding an employee at the end of the array.
Search Operation: 
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n) - Searching for an employee involves traversing the array.
Traverse Operation: 
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n) - Traversing involves iterating through all elements.
Delete Operation:  𝑂(𝑛)
O(n) - Deletion involves searching for the element and shifting subsequent elements.
Limitations of Arrays
Fixed Size: The size of the array must be known at the time of creation, which limits flexibility.
Inefficient Deletion: Deleting an element requires shifting all subsequent elements, which is inefficient.
Memory Wastage: If the array is not fully utilized, memory is wasted.
When to Use Arrays
Small Data Sets: When managing a relatively small and fixed number of elements.
Performance: When constant time access to elements is required.
